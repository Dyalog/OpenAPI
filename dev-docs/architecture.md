# Architecture

## Overview

The generator is a .NET CLI application. Given an OpenAPI spec file, it produces a self-contained Dyalog APL client. The pipeline has three stages: **parse**, **model**, **render**.

```
OpenAPI spec (JSON/YAML)
        │
        ▼
  OpenApiService          — parses the spec into a Microsoft.OpenApi document object
        │
        ▼
  CodeGeneratorService    — orchestrates generation; delegates to three sub-services:
  ├── ArtifactGeneratorService   — utils.apln, Version.aplf, HttpCommand.aplc, Client.aplc, README.md
  ├── EndpointGeneratorService   — one .aplf per operation, grouped under _tags/<tag>/
  └── ModelGeneratorService      — model classes (not yet implemented)
        │
        ▼
  TemplateService         — renders each Scriban template with its context object
        │
        ▼
  Output directory        — APLSource/ tree + README.md
```

## Services

### `GeneratorApplication`

The CLI entry point. Parses arguments into a `GeneratorOptions` object, constructs and wires up all services manually (no DI framework is used), calls `OpenApiService` to load the spec, then calls `CodeGeneratorService.GenerateAsync()`. Returns exit code 0 on success, 1 on any failure.

### `OpenApiService`

Wraps `Microsoft.OpenApi.Reader` to parse and optionally validate the spec. Returns an `OpenApiParseResult` containing the parsed document and any diagnostics. Both JSON and YAML input are supported.

### `CodeGeneratorService`

Thin orchestrator. Calls the three sub-services in order:

1. `ArtifactGeneratorService` — shared/static artifacts
2. `EndpointGeneratorService` — per-operation function files
3. `ModelGeneratorService` — model classes (currently no-ops)

### `ArtifactGeneratorService`

Generates files that are the same regardless of the number of operations:

| Output file | Template |
|---|---|
| `APLSource/utils.apln` | `utils.apln.scriban` |
| `APLSource/Version.aplf` | `Version.aplf.scriban` |
| `APLSource/HttpCommand.aplc` | Embedded binary (copied directly) |
| `APLSource/Client.aplc` | `Client.aplc.scriban` |
| `README.md` | `README.md.scriban` |

The original spec file is also copied into the output directory.

### `EndpointGeneratorService`

Groups all operations by tag, then for each operation:

1. Constructs an `OperationTemplateContext` from the OpenAPI operation object
2. Resolves the request body type and form fields
3. Converts path parameter placeholders into Dyalog APL concatenation expressions via `PathConverter`
4. Renders `endpoint.aplf.scriban` and writes to `APLSource/_tags/<tag>/<OperationId>.aplf`

Operations with no tag are placed under the `default` tag.

### `ModelGeneratorService`

Placeholder — both public methods are intentional no-ops. Model generation is planned but not yet implemented.

### `TemplateService`

Loads Scriban templates from embedded assembly resources and renders them with a context object. When building the Scriban script object, all C# property names are converted to `snake_case` so templates use `operation_id` rather than `OperationId`. `CustomProperties` dictionaries on context objects are merged in the same way.

Two custom template functions are registered:

- `comment_lines` — prefixes each line of a string with `⍝`
- `get_operations_by_tag` — returns operations grouped by tag, for use in the README template

## Context objects

Each template receives a typed context object. The two main ones are:

**`ApiTemplateContext`** — used for document-level templates (Client, Utils, README, etc.). Exposes the full OpenAPI document, API title/version/description, base URL, all tags, and security scheme metadata.

**`OperationTemplateContext`** — used for endpoint templates. Exposes a single operation's method, path, parameters, request body (including content type and resolved field names), response codes, and security requirements.

## Key utilities

**`PathConverter`** — converts an OpenAPI path template such as `/pets/{petId}` into a Dyalog APL expression: `'/pets/',(⍕argsNs.petId)`. Segments and parameter references are concatenated with `,`.

**`StringHelpers.ToValidAplName`** — converts an arbitrary string into a valid APL identifier. If the name contains characters outside the APL identifier character set, or begins with a digit, it is prefixed with `⍙` and each invalid character is replaced with `⍙<UCS code>⍙`. This is the same escaping scheme used by Dyalog's JSON name mangling (`7159⌶`).

## Design notes

**Why Scriban?** Scriban is a lightweight, embeddable .NET templating language with good whitespace control. It keeps the template logic close to the generated APL source rather than buried in C# string manipulation.

**Why no DI framework?** The service graph is shallow and fixed. Manual construction in `GeneratorApplication` keeps the project dependency-light and startup fast.

**How do errors propagate?** `OpenApiService` returns a result object rather than throwing; the caller checks `IsSuccess` and logs diagnostics. Template rendering errors surface as exceptions and are caught at the top-level `GeneratorApplication` handler, which logs them and returns exit code 1.
