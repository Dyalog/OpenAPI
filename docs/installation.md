    No additional setup is required. You can run the binary directly from any terminal.

    To make it available from anywhere, move it to a directory on your `PATH`, for example `C:\Windows\System32`, or add its containing folder to your `PATH` in System Settings.

    Mark the binary as executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x openapidyalog-linux-x64
    ```

    Optionally, move it onto your `PATH` so it can be run from anywhere:
