# Client Class

`Client.aplc` is the main entry point of the generated client. It is a Dyalog APL class that wires together all the generated operation namespaces and handles shared concerns — base URL, authentication, cookies, and HTTP dispatch.

## Creating an instance

The constructor takes a single config namespace. `baseUrl` is the only required field.

```apl
config ← (
    baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com'
)

client ← ⎕NEW Client config
```

## Config fields

| Field&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Required | Default | Description |
|-------------|---|---|---|
| `baseUrl`   | Yes | | Root URL prepended to every request path. |
| `mock`      | No | `¯1` | Controls whether requests are actually sent. See [Mock mode](#mock-mode). |
| `headers`   | No | `⍬` | Extra headers sent with every request, as a vector of name–value pairs. |
| `security` | No[^1] | | Authentication credentials. See [Authentication](#authentication). |

[^1]: Required if the API uses authentication.

## Authentication

API key, HTTP bearer, and HTTP basic authentication are supported. OAuth is not currently implemented, but planned to be implemented.

Set a `security` namespace on the config with the fields required by the API's authentication scheme. Only provide the fields relevant to the scheme used.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `apiKey` | API key value, for specs that use `apiKey` security. |
| `bearerToken` | Bearer token, for specs that use HTTP bearer security. |
| `username` | Username for HTTP basic auth. |
| `password` | Password for HTTP basic auth. |

## Tag fields

After construction, the client exposes one public field per API tag. Calling an operation looks like:

```apl
client.<tag>.<OperationId> <args>
```

For example, if the spec defines a `user` tag with a `ListUsers` operation:

```apl
client.user.ListUsers ()
```

Operations with no tag in the spec are grouped under a `default` field.

## Mock mode

The `mock` config field controls whether requests are actually sent:

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `¯1` | Send the request and return the response normally. |
| `1` | Build the request but do not send it; return the raw HttpCommand request object. |
| `2` | Return the HttpCommand argument namespace directly, without building or sending the request. |

## Debug mode

Setting `client.∆.Debug←1` prints the raw HTTP request to the session before sending it.

```apl
client.∆.Debug ← 1
client.user.ListUsers ()   ⍝ prints request details to the session
```

This is not compatible with `mock←2`.
